# What is Claude Code?


A **command-line coding assistant** that understands your codebase, remembers your changes and creates plans.

It can work autonomously for hours, if you let it.
Unless you get ratelimited, ofc. Because this thing consumes A LOT of tokens.

But limits reset every 5h, thankfully. Or you can just upgrade to the $200/month max plan.

Remember to treat it like a junior dev: always inspect the diff and make sure it cannot do any real harm.

## Core Capabilities

- üìù **Feature Building** - It creates a plan to gather context and apply code changes
- üêõ **Debugging** - Runs tests, understands the errors, applies fixes
- üó∫Ô∏è **Project Navigation** - Understand and navigates project structure
- üîß **Direct Integration** - Works with existing development tools (VSCode)

# Claude Code vs traditional ChatGPT Ctrl+C/V or Copilot

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-8 mt-8">

<div>

## ChatGPT Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V
- Manual copy and paste of the context
- Time-consuming debugging
- Context switching between browser and code
- No agentic mode

</div>

<div>

## Copilot Tab completion
- Limited Context-aware suggestions
- No planning capabilities (search the web, look around the codebase...)
- Often in the way when writing normal code

</div>

<div>

## Claude Code
- Automatic context selection
- Makes coordinated changes across multiple files
- Uses your test suites and build systems
- Asks for permission to run bash commands
- Adapts to your coding standards and patterns

</div>

# Common Workflows with Subagents
- **Understand new codebases**: Ask broad questions about architecture, then dive into specifics
    - `> give me an overview of this codebase`
    - `> explain the main architecture patterns used here`
- **Code analysis**: Find relevant files, trace execution flows, identify issues
    - `> find the files that handle user authentication`
    - `> trace the login process from front-end to database`
- **Bug fixing**: Let claude help you debug problems
    - `> I'm seeing an error when I run npm test`
    - `> update user.ts to add the null check you suggested`
- **Refactor Code**: apply consistent changes to improve the codebase
    - `> suggest how to refactor utils.js to use modern JavaScript features`
    - `> run tests for the refactored code`

# Workflow Evolution Patterns

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6">

<div class="p-4 border rounded">

## Beginner
- Direct task prompting
- Single conversation sessions
- Manual file editing
- Basic debugging requests

</div>

<div class="p-4 border rounded">

## Intermediate
- **Living document** methodology
- Context management with CLAUDE.md
- Multi-session planning
- Visual iteration with screenshots

</div>

<div class="p-4 border rounded">

## Advanced
- **Collaborative design partner** approach
- Parallel subagent workflows
- Custom command development
- Multi-agent system implementations

# Best Practices

## üìù CLAUDE.md
- Include code style guidelines, run scripts/tests
- Structured in bullet points and markdown headers
- Treated as authoritative system rules
`/init` to explore the codebase and create ./CLAUDE.md
- `# Remind this` to add to memory
    - `/memory` to directly edit it with
- Recursive priority:
  1) $CWD/CLAUDE.md
  2) ../$CWD/CLAUDE.md (until root folder)
  3) ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (general)


::right::

<div class="text-sm">

## üéØ Misc Tips
<div class="text-s leading-tight space-y-1">

- **Course correct early** `(ESC)` and often
- Use `/clear` to keep context focused
- `shift+tab` to auto accept code changes
- Plan mode for read only operations
- Use git worktrees to avoid catastrophes

</div>

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques
<div class="text-s leading-tight space-y-1">

- MCP integration (e.g. for Drive, Jira...)
- Headless mode for automation
- **Subagents** for parallel processing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `/hooks`
- Unix approach
    - `cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'explain this build error' > output.txt`

# ‚ùå Common Pitfalls

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

- Vague or ambiguous requests
- Skipping human code review
- Over-relying without understanding changes
- Poor context management

</div>

<div>

- Ignoring existing project conventions
- Complex multi-agent setups initially
- Assuming AI knows your preferences

# Subagents: Specialized AI Assistants

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

## What are Subagents?
- **Specialized AI assistants** with unique expertise
- **Separate context windows** to preserve main conversation
- **Custom system prompts** and tool permissions
- **Proactive delegation** based on task descriptions

## Creating Subagents
```bash
# List existing subagents
/agents

# Create a new subagent
/agents create code-reviewer
```

</div>

<div>

## Common Subagent Examples

### Code Reviewer
```
Expert code review specialist. Proactively
reviews code for quality, security, and
maintainability.
```

### Debugger
```
Debugging specialist for errors, test
failures, and unexpected behavior.
```

### Data Scientist
```
Data analysis expert for SQL queries,
BigQuery operations, and data insights.
```

# Claude Code Router & Model Options
Router requests to other models, rather than Sonnet/Opus

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

## Claude Code Router
- **Dynamic model routing** across providers
- Support for OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Gemini
- **Custom routing logic** via JavaScript
- **GitHub Actions integration**
- On-the-fly model switching

## Setup
```bash
npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
```

</div>

<div>

## GLM-4.5, a cheaper alternative
- **$3/month** GLM Coding Plan
- **355B parameters** (32B active)
- **128k token context**


## vLLM, Qwen3-Coder-480B
- It runs on our infra
- Free (?)
- Need to actually test it to see if it works

# Let's see how well he does the backend challenge

### Instructions I received ~2 years ago from Angela

<div class="text-xs mt-0 pt-0">
Your company is behind an online forum about cooking. The users need to register into it providing their email, password, some basic profile info, and then perform a safe login. In order to increase the safety of the login process, a user can enable the 2FA at the registration step to receive at the provided email a random OTP needed to complete the flow. To reduce the complexity of the assignment (if you want) you can use as Email Sender component a fake implementation that simply logs on the stdout the OTP rather than send the email for real.
You‚Äôre responsible to design a backend service and to actually code it in Python. You must version this project with git and provide a public URL where we can check your solution. Please don‚Äôt put any reference to our company inside the repository.

Some constraints:

provide a README.md file with clear instructions about how we can test your service in a local development environment;

the communication protocol will be HTTP. We expect one route to register users, a second route to allow them to log in and a third to use in case the 2FA is enabled. You‚Äôre free to design as you like, but you‚Äôre asked to provide documentation for all of the endpoints;

this service will operate inside a micro-services architecture and must be shipped inside a docker image, in order to be deployable in the cloud;

we expect you to write automated tests for your project.

Avoid using a library to generate the otp

the session must be managed via stateless authentication with JWT
